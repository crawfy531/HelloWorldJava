//the first public class (usually called main) needs to match the name of the file

public class HelloWorld {

    //this is the required main method that does not take in or take out variables to other methods
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //this outputs in the system to print on the commandline "Hello World"
        //must be "" and not '' in the parenthises
        System.out.println("Hello World");
